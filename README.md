AI Resume Analyzer


Created an AI-powered tool to evaluate resumes based on job descriptions using NLP techniques. Extracted key skills, education, and experience from resumes and matched them against role-specific requirements to generate relevance scores. Implemented using Python libraries like NLTK/spaCy and integrated with a user-friendly interface.
